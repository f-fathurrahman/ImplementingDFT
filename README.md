A very rough draft for a book entitled:

*Implementing Density Functional Theory Calculations*.

Authors: Fadjar Fathurrahman and Hermawan Kresno Dipojono.

Affiliation: Dept. of Engineering Physics. Institut Teknologi Bandung.
Bandung, West Java, Indonesia.

In this book, we tried to explore how to implement density functional
theory calculations using (mainly) finite difference method.
The programs are written in Julia programming language.

The references are not yet complete. Many works should be cited.
