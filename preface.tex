Importance of density functional theory

Implementation of density functional theory in various program packages (free and commercial)

Several books about density functional theories

The problem: not yet giving necessary details

This book is our humble attempt to demystifying several aspects of practical density functional
theory to beginners in the field.

Objective of this book: show the reader how to implement a density functional theory
for simple system containing only model potential (such as harmonic potential)
and to non-local pseudopotentials which are usually used in typical DFT calculations
for molecular and crystalline systems.

Outline of the book:
1d, 2d, 3d, Schrodinger equation, Poisson equation, Kohn-Sham equation for local
(pseudo)potentials, Kohn-Sham equation for nonlocal pseudopotentials.

This is for \textit{acknowledgments}.
