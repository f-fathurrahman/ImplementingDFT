\chapter{Schroedinger equation in 3d}

After we have considered two-dimensional Schroedinger equations, we are now ready for
the extension to three-dimensional systems. In 3d, Schroedinger equation can be
written as:
\begin{equation}
\left[ -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) \right] \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E\,\psi(\mathbf{r})
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{r}$ is the abbreviation to $(x,y,z)$ and
%
$\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator in 3d:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} +
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Three-dimensional grid}

As in the preceeding chapter, our first task is to create a representation of 3d grid
points and various quantities defined on it. This task is realized using straightforward
extension of \txtinline{FD2dGrid} to \txtinline{FD3dGrid}.

\subsection{Laplacian operator}

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{L} = \mathbb{D}^{(2)}_{x} \otimes \mathbb{I}_{y} \otimes \mathbb{I}_{z} +
\mathbb{I}_{x} \otimes \mathbb{D}^{(2)}_{y} \otimes \mathbb{I}_{z} +
\mathbb{I}_{x} \otimes \mathbb{I}_{y} \otimes \mathbb{D}^{(2)}_{z}
\end{equation}


Code
\begin{juliacode}
const ⊗ = kron
function build_nabla2_matrix( fdgrid::FD3dGrid; func_1d=build_D2_matrix_3pt )
    D2x = func_1d(fdgrid.Nx, fdgrid.hx)
    D2y = func_1d(fdgrid.Ny, fdgrid.hy)
    D2z = func_1d(fdgrid.Nz, fdgrid.hz)
    IIx = speye(fdgrid.Nx)
    IIy = speye(fdgrid.Ny)
    IIz = speye(fdgrid.Nz)
    ∇2 = D2x⊗IIy⊗IIz + IIx⊗D2y⊗IIz + IIx⊗IIy⊗D2z 
    return ∇2
end
\end{juliacode}
